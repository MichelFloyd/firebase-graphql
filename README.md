# Test GraphQL Setup on Firebase Functions (which are not quite the same as Google Cloud Functions)
This repo based on https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started?gen=2nd

The directory structure has been flattened somewhat so that [src](./src), [package.json](package.json), and the various firebase files are at the root level instead of under [functions](./functions)
